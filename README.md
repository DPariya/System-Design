# System Design - Design Patterns and Principles Demo

This project is a comprehensive demo of **Design Patterns**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **SOLID principles**, and other best practices in software design.

## Project Overview

- Demonstrates core **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** design patterns.
- Covers **SOLID** principles with practical examples.
- Showcases **problem** and **solution** implementations side-by-side.
- Uses Java language for clear, industry-standard coding practices.
- Helps improve understanding of how to write maintainable, scalable, and reusable code.
- Each pattern is organized by type and shows both the **problem** and the **solution**.
- Allows easy comparison and learning from real coding examples.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a specific design pattern folder.
2. Study the `problem` code to understand the drawbacks or issues without design patterns.
3. Explore the `solution` code to see how applying the design pattern solves these problems.
4. Run `Main.java` files to see the behavior in action.
